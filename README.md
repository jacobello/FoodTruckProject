# Food Truck Project
## Overview
Users will input and rate a list of food trucks, then view the average rating and the highest-rated truck.
## Structure
* Define a class with fields with properties including an unique identification number, a truck name, food type, and a numeric rating.

* Create a separate class with a main method that runs the program.  
	* Create an array to store up to 5 FoodTruck objects.
	
		* The main method of this class is the only static method in the entire project. 
		
## User Stories:

###User Story #1
The user is prompted to input the name, food type, and rating for up to five food trucks. For each set of input, a FoodTruck object is created, its fields set to the user's input, and it is added to the array. The truck id is not input by the user, but instead assigned automatically in the FoodTruck constructor from a static field that is incremented as each truck is created.

###User Story #2
If the user inputs quit for the food truck name, input ends immediately and the program continues.

###User Story #3
After input is complete, the user sees a menu from which they can choose to:
	
* List all existing food trucks.
		
* See the average rating of food trucks.	
	
* Display the highest-rated food truck.	
	
* Quit the program.		

###User Story #4
After choosing a menu item, the user sees the menu again and can choose another item until the choose to quit.


## Technologies Used:
* Java
* Eclipse
* Terminal
* GitHub Version control

## Lessons Learned:

After this project, I have a deeper understanding of the usage of Class, Array, Method, etc... and how to manipulate them in building an application.

I also applied several Eclipse techniques introduced this week to generate toString(), getters and setters, and constructors using fields.  

I find it is beneficial to read the project requirement thoroughly and plan out what needs to be done in writing.
